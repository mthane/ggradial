# ggradial

The package 'ggradial' provides geoms for ‘ggplot2’ with radial bar chart and radial line chart extensions in order to visualize high-dimensional clusters and their evolution.

* radial_barchart_static: Creates a radial barchart which shows a cluster's average feature values.
* radial_barchart_compare: Creates a radial barchart which shows a cluster's average feature values and allows a comparison between different points in time. 
* radial_line_chart: Creates a radial line chart which shows the average feature values for each cluster.
